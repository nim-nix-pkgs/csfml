  ## non-attenuated music, i.e. its volume will always be the same
  ## whether it is heard from near or from far. On the other hand,
  ## an attenuation value such as 100 will make the music fade out
  ## very quickly as it gets further from the listener.

  ## 
  ## *Arguments*:
  ## - ``music``:        Music object
  ## - ``attenuation``:  New attenuation factor of the music
